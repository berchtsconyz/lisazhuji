## Scraping Walmart Product Data

Hereâ€™s how to extract product information from Walmart using Python:

### 1. **Setup Your Environment**
Start by importing all the necessary libraries. Weâ€™ll use:
- `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML.
- `Selenium` for handling dynamically loaded content.
- `pandas` for organizing data into structured formats.
- `SQLAlchemy` for saving the scraped data to a database.

```python
import os
import time
import pandas as pd
from selenium import webdriver
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

### 2. **Prepare the URLs**
Walmart organizes its products into categories. Start by identifying the URLs of product subcategories. For example:

```python
url_sets = [
    "https://www.walmart.com/browse/tv-video/all-tvs/3944_1060825_447913",
    "https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/all-laptop-computers/3944_3951_1089430_132960",
]
categories = ["TVs", "Laptops"]
```

You can customize these URLs to target specific product categories.

### 3. **Extract Data From Pages**
Use a loop to iterate through product pages and extract relevant data like:
- Product name
- Price
- Description
- Ratings
- Related products

Hereâ€™s an example of a scraping loop:

```python
final_results = []

for category, url in zip(categories, url_sets):
    print(f"Scraping category: {category}")
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='C:/Drivers/chromedriver.exe')
    driver.get(url)

    body = driver.find_element_by_tag_name("body").get_attribute("innerHTML")
    driver.quit()

    soup = BeautifulSoup(body, "html.parser")
    products = soup.find_all('div', {'class': 'search-result-gridview-item-wrapper'})

    for product in products:
        product_name = product.find('a', {'class': 'product-title-link'}).text.strip()
        product_price = product.find('span', {'class': 'price-group'}).text.strip()
        product_url = "https://walmart.com" + product.find('a', {'class': 'product-title-link'})['href']
        
        final_results.append([category, product_name, product_price, product_url])
```

---

### 4. **Organize Data in a DataFrame**
Use `pandas` to organize the data into a structured format.

```python
import pandas as pd

columns = ["Category", "Product Name", "Price", "Product URL"]
df = pd.DataFrame(final_results, columns=columns)
print(df.head())
```

---

### 5. **Save Data to SQL**
You can export the scraped data to a SQL database for further analysis.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector://username:password@host/database')
df.to_sql(name='walmart_products', con=engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

Replace `username`, `password`, `host`, and `database` with your SQL database credentials.

## Challenges in Scraping Walmart

1. **Dynamic Content**: Walmart uses JavaScript to load product information, which is why we use Selenium to render pages.
2. **Anti-Bot Protections**: Websites like Walmart may block scraping attempts. Using tools like [ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi) can help bypass these restrictions.
3. **Data Accuracy**: Always ensure your scraper handles missing or incomplete data gracefully.

## Code Snippet: Full Scraper Example

Hereâ€™s a simplified version of the full Walmart scraper:

```python
import time
import pandas as pd
from selenium import webdriver
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# URL list and categories
url_sets = [
    "https://www.walmart.com/browse/tv-video/all-tvs/3944_1060825_447913",
    "https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/all-laptop-computers/3944_3951_1089430_132960",
]
categories = ["TVs", "Laptops"]

# Initialize results list
final_results = []

for category, url in zip(categories, url_sets):
    print(f"Scraping category: {category}")
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='C:/Drivers/chromedriver.exe')
    driver.get(url)

    time.sleep(5)  # Allow time for page to load
    body = driver.find_element_by_tag_name("body").get_attribute("innerHTML")
    driver.quit()

    soup = BeautifulSoup(body, "html.parser")
    products = soup.find_all('div', {'class': 'search-result-gridview-item-wrapper'})

    for product in products:
        try:
            product_name = product.find('a', {'class': 'product-title-link'}).text.strip()
            product_price = product.find('span', {'class': 'price-group'}).text.strip()
            product_url = "https://walmart.com" + product.find('a', {'class': 'product-title-link'})['href']
            final_results.append([category, product_name, product_price, product_url])
        except AttributeError:
            continue

# Create DataFrame
columns = ["Category", "Product Name", "Price", "Product URL"]
df = pd.DataFrame(final_results, columns=columns)

# Save to CSV
df.to_csv("walmart_products.csv", index=False)
print("Scraping completed. Data saved to walmart_products.csv")
```

## Tips for Advanced Scraping

1. **Error Handling**: Add exception handling to deal with missing data or page loading issues.
2. **Scaling**: Loop through multiple subcategories to scrape larger datasets.
3. **Proxies**: Use residential or mobile proxies to avoid IP bans.
