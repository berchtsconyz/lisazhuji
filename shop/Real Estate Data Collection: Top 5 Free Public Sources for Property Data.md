## Challenges in Collecting Public Real Estate Data

While public sources are invaluable, they come with several challenges:

1. **Access Restrictions:** Free sources often impose limitations on data extraction rates or restrict access based on IP addresses and time zones.
2. **Captcha and Security:** Many websites use security measures like captchas to prevent web scraping.
