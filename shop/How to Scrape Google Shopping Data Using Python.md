## Scraping Google Shopping Search Results

### **Step 1: Analyze Google Shopping SERP**
Use browser developer tools to inspect Google Shopping pages and identify elements like product titles, prices, and retailers.

### **Step 2: Write the Scraper**
Here's a basic scraper to extract Google Shopping results:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_google_shopping(query):
    url = f"https://www.google.com/search?tbm=shop&q={query}"
    headers = {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)"
    }
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

    products = []
    for item in soup.select(".sh-dgr__grid-result"):
        title = item.select_one("h4").text if item.select_one("h4") else None
        price = item.select_one(".a8Pemb").text if item.select_one(".a8Pemb") else None
        retailer = item.select_one(".aULzUe").text if item.select_one(".aULzUe") else None

        products.append({
            "title": title,
            "price": price,
            "retailer": retailer
        })

    return products

# Example usage
query = "laptops"
data = scrape_google_shopping(query)
print(data)
```

---

## Saving Scraped Data to JSON

After scraping, save the data for analysis:
```python
import json

def save_to_json(data, filename="products.json"):
    with open(filename, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=4, ensure_ascii=False)

# Save scraped data
save_to_json(data)
```
