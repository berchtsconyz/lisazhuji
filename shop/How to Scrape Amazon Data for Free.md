# Fetch product page
response = requests.get(BASE_URL, params=params)

if response.status_code == 200:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    # Extract product name
    product_name = soup.find("span", {"id": "productTitle"}).text.strip()
    print(f"Product Name: {product_name}")
