## What Is Web Scraping?

Web scraping refers to the automated process of extracting data from websites and web servers. It enables organizations and individuals to collect large volumes of data efficiently for various purposes, such as market research, trend analysis, and lead generation.

Most of the data available on the internet is unstructured, usually in HTML format. Web scraping tools help convert this data into structured formats, such as spreadsheets or databases, making it more usable.

## Why Is Web Scraping Important?

Web scraping automates data collection, enabling businesses to unlock valuable insights from publicly available web data. It helps organizations harness the power of big data, make informed decisions, and gain a competitive edge.

For example, web scraping is used in:
- **Price Monitoring**: Tracking competitors' pricing strategies in e-commerce.
- **Lead Generation**: Gathering contact details to reach potential customers.
- **Market Analysis**: Understanding consumer sentiment and trends.
- **Product Research**: Extracting product descriptions and images for online stores.

With advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, web scraping tools can analyze billions of data points in minutes, making the process faster and more reliable.

2. **Data Extraction**: Extracting information like text, images, or metadata.
3. **Data Processing**: Converting the extracted data into usable formats like CSV or JSON.

## Advanced Web Scraping Techniques

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have transformed web scraping by enabling tools to analyze data more effectively. For example, computer vision allows tools to extract data from images and interpret human-readable content on web pages.
