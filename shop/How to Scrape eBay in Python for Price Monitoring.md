## Tools and Libraries for eBay Scraping

Python is one of the best programming languages for web scraping due to its simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries.

### **Recommended Libraries**
- **[Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):** A powerful library for sending HTTP requests and retrieving web content.
- **[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/):** A flexible HTML parser to extract and navigate the DOM structure.

These libraries are enough for eBay scraping since much of eBay‚Äôs data is embedded directly in the HTML.

## Step-by-Step: Scraping eBay Product Data

Follow these steps to create your eBay scraper.

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Python Environment**
1. Install Python 3+ from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Create a project folder and initialize a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   mkdir ebay-scraper
   cd ebay-scraper
   python -m venv env
   ```
3. Create a `scraper.py` file:
   ```python
   print('Hello, World!')
   ```
   Verify it works by running:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
Install `Beautiful Soup` and `Requests`:
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```
Import them in `scraper.py`:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

---

### **Step 3: Download eBay Web Pages**
Extract eBay product pages using `Requests`. For example:
```python
url = 'https://www.ebay.com/itm/<ITEM_ID>'
page = requests.get(url)
```

---

### **Step 4: Parse HTML with Beautiful Soup**
Parse the HTML content to extract product details:
```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text, 'html.parser')
```

---

### **Step 5: Extract Price Data**
Locate price and shipping details in the HTML using CSS selectors:
```python
price = soup.select_one('.x-price-primary span[itemprop="price"]')['content']
currency = soup.select_one('.x-price-primary span[itemprop="priceCurrency"]')['content']
```

For shipping costs:
```python
shipping_price = soup.select_one('.ux-labels-values__labels + .ux-textspans--BOLD').text
```

---

### **Step 6: Scrape Product Details**
Scrape detailed product attributes from the ‚ÄúAbout this Item‚Äù section:
```python
item_details = {}
for row in soup.select('.ux-layout-section-evo__col'):
    key = row.select_one('.ux-labels-values__labels').text
    value = row.select_one('.ux-labels-values__values').text
    item_details[key] = value
```

---

### **Step 7: Export Data to JSON**
Save the scraped data to a JSON file:
```python
import json

with open('product_info.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(item_details, file, indent=4)
```

## Full Python Script: eBay Scraper

Below is the complete `scraper.py` script:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

if len(sys.argv) <= 1:
    print("Item ID argument missing!")
    sys.exit(2)

item_id = sys.argv[1]
url = f'https://www.ebay.com/itm/{item_id}'
page = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text, 'html.parser')

item = {}
item['price'] = soup.select_one('.x-price-primary span[itemprop="price"]')['content']
item['currency'] = soup.select_one('.x-price-primary span[itemprop="priceCurrency"]')['content']

shipping_label = soup.select_one('.ux-labels-values__labels + .ux-textspans--BOLD')
if shipping_label:
    item['shipping_price'] = shipping_label.text

for row in soup.select('.ux-layout-section-evo__col'):
    key = row.select_one('.ux-labels-values__labels').text.strip()
    value = row.select_one('.ux-labels-values__values').text.strip()
    item[key] = value

with open('product_info.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(item, file, indent=4)

print(f"Scraped data saved to product_info.json")
```
